  type:
    "Presentation"
  abstract:
    '<p>Interpolated strings, like the familiar `s""`, provide a convenient way to embed external DSLs in Scala source, allowing you to construct a new value at runtime from a string literal, with Scala expressions substituted within it.</p>

    <p>But unless you are prepared to implement the interpolator using a macro, the compiler provides no checks on the correctness or well-formedness of the embedded DSL.</p>

    <p>Contextual is a small open-source library which does the heavy lifting work to make it trivial to write string interpolators which run at compile time, without requiring any macro code. A string interpolator which parses and checks a DSL at compile-time -- with its own custom error-messages -- can be written using contextual in just a few lines of ordinary "userspace" code, calling upon parsers, regular expressions or any other means to check the interpolated string.</p>

    <p>This opens up a smorgasbord of possibilities for adding more compile-time safety to Scala code, not least the ability to introduce your own literal-like types, ranging from checked email addresses or URLs to compile-time-parsed YAML, CSS or GraphQL.</p>'

    <p>The talk will show the so called "final encoding" technique that is somehow related to

    can be "interpreted" differently according to your mood, but compose more natural than coproducts
    and free monads.  I want to show in this presentation a way to write a whole web service using
    for example http4s or akka-http in this style and how nice it is for testing stuff by swapping

    as Functor, Applicative, Monad and so on. That brings to this talk on the essence of functional structures.

    their core essences, and discuss intuitions on how to apply them in solving problems in a purely
    functional manner.</p>

    <p>From scratch, we will construct the type classes to represent these structures in Scala. Starting
    with basic constructs such as Monoid, we will continue exploring structures such as Functor, Applicative,
    Monad, Foldable and finally, Traversable. Alongside, from the practical point of view, we will dive into
    the essence of these structures in encoding pure functional programs that are robust, comprehensible
    and correct-by-construction.</p>

     <p>As an audience, I would get a comprehensive overview of several functional abstractions, learn

    DSLs that can only be understood by a select band of European ethnomusicologists. Computational musicologists
    can solve this problem, because we have principled ways of modelling specific idioms in terms of general
    computation. What's more, our models can be executed to generate actual music.</p>

    <p>Simha Arom is a French-Israeli ethnomusicologist. In the book from which the title of this talk is
    borrowed, he describes the principles underlying the musical system of traditional central African polyphony
    and polyrhythm. Arom invented ingenious recording techniques for deconstructing and systematising musical
    cultures that had no previous tradition of musical theory. He tested his models by using them to recreate
    music and inviting central African musicians to critique the results.</p>

    <p>This talk will argue that music-as-code is an ideal way to represent Arom's insights. I will show the
    full truth in the Lévi-Strauss quote with which Arom prefaces his book:
    \"The proof of the analysis is in the synthesis.\" Programming has played its part in the homogenisation of
    global culture, but the universality of the lambda calculus also affords a golden opportunity for code to

  abstract:
    "<p>Its always challenge to build a good abstraction during work on library. Library codebase must
    be flexible and modular when user code must be clean and easy understandable. One of variants to
    build API between library and customer its Free evaluation approach. In that case you as developer
    is free to interpret customer actions as you want and customer is free to define actions as he
    want. In my talk I will show how to build API based on recursive abstract data types, describe why
    its cool and demonstrate some tricks on type system to make customer experience with library better.</p>"
